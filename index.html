                        Hello! My name is Nikolas Haug. I am currently a student in the University of Minnesota Coding Boot Camp program in the Twin Cities. I've been learning to code on my own for about a year now, and am hoping this course will further extend and complement the knowledge I've acquired thus far. I'm very interested in the front-end side of development, but am looking forward to gaining a full-stack knowledge in the program. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my studies in code, I have a BA degree in English literature and French. I have worked as an ESL teacher abroad and at home, and continue to support local institutions as a volunteer or substitue when able. I love books and music, and have spent a lot of time making things with words and instruments. I believe this passion will not fail me in the world of coding. I look forward to the new opportunities and possibilities that this course will present.
                    </p>
                    <br>
